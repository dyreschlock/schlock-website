1
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:09,000
Due to the current emergency situation, all phone lines have been suspended.

2
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:12,507
No good, huh? Even the phones are out.

3
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:15,512
The buses and trains have all stopped too.

4
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:22,019
Guess I won't be making it. Too bad...

5
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:24,524
I should head to a shelter.

6
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:01,562
Focus all fire on the target!

7
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:22,584
Sorry to have kept you waiting!

8
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:42,603
The target is still intact. It is progressing toward tokyo-3!

9
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:45,608
The Air Force is unable to damage it!

10
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:49,612
Throw everything at it! Mobilize the 4th armored division to intercept!

11
00:02:49,617 --> 00:02:52,617
Don't hold back! Destroy the target at all cost!

12
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:17,644
How?! That was a direct hit!

13
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:22,648
The tank battalion was completely destroyed. Missiles had no effect on it...

14
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:26,653
Damnit! What are we supposed to do against something like that?!

15
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:28,657
As we thought, an A.T. field...

16
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:31,661
Yes, conventional weapons are useless against the Angel.

17
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:38,668
Understood. We will proceed as planned.

18
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:46,177
No way... They're using an N2 Mine?!

19
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:47,181
Get down!

20
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:07,703
We did it!

21
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:10,204
I'm afraid we've left nothing for you to do.

22
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,708
Shockwave incoming!

23
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,711
Are you okay?

24
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:17,214
Yeah. I just have some dirt in my mouth.

25
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:18,718
That's alright.

26
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:23,721
Are you ready? And--push!

27
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:33,233
Thanks a lot. Good job.

28
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:36,737
Ah, I should be thanking you Katsuragi-san.

29
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,741
Call me Misato.

30
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:42,245
It's nice to meet you, Ikari Shinji-kun.

31
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,249
Me too.

32
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:45,251
What is the target's status?

33
00:04:45,255 --> 00:04:48,255
There's no way it could survive such a massive explosion.

34
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,759
Recovering image.

35
00:05:01,774 --> 00:05:04,274
Our trump card failed!

36
00:05:04,277 --> 00:05:06,777
How is this possible...

37
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,280
It's a monster!

38
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:11,783
The gate will be closing. Please be careful.

39
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,290
Secret Military Agency NERV?

40
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:18,292
Yes, it is a private organization under the direct supervision of the United Nations.

41
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:20,296
It's where my father is right?

42
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:23,299
Yes, well. Do you know what he does?

43
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:31,808
"Work of utmost importance in the protection of humanity," is what the teacher said.

44
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:38,814
From this point on, you will be in command of this operation. Show us what you can do.

45
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,321
Understood.

46
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:46,823
Ikari-kun, from our available weapons, we admit we have no effective means of disabling the target.

47
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:49,331
Are you confident you can succeed?

48
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:51,835
It is why NERV exists.

49
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,339
Are we heading to where my father is?

50
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:57,842
Well, yes. We are.

51
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,350
Father...

52
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:07,854
Oh, were you given an I.D. by your father?

53
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:12,859
Ah, here it is.

54
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:14,865
Thanks.

55
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:18,868
Go ahead and read this.

56
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:20,372
NERV.

57
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,375
My father's work.

58
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:25,878
Is there something I'm needed for?

59
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:32,883
Of course. He wouldn't send me a letter for nothing.

60
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,890
You think your father is a tough guy? Me too.

61
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:40,897
Huh?

62
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:47,902
Amazing! It's a real Geofront!

63
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:52,908
Yes. This is our secret base: NERV Headquarters.

64
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:56,914
It is the foundation for rebuilding our world and the last defence for humanity.

65
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:06,927
Ah... Ritsuko!

66
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:12,931
You're 12 minutes over schedule. It doesn't take this long to pick someone up.

67
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:17,437
We're short on manpower and we don't have any time to waste, Captain Katsuragi.

68
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:18,442
Sorry.

69
00:07:21,948 --> 00:07:23,948
This is the man's son?

70
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:24,951
Yes.

71
00:07:24,953 --> 00:07:28,953
I am director of the 1st science division of E-project, Akagi Ritsuko.

72
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,958
It's nice to meet you.

73
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:31,961
Me too.

74
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:33,962
Well then, I'll leave the rest to you.

75
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:39,969
Meeting his son after 3 years...

76
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:45,976
Ikari Shinij-kun, there's something I want to show you.

77
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:55,984
This is the ultimate humanoid fighting machine. The cyborg Evangelion.

78
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:59,991
That is Unit 01.
It is our last and greatest weapon.

79
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:02,496
This is my fathers work?

80
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:04,999
Yes it is.

81
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:08,003
It's been a long time.

82
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:10,007
Father...

83
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:14,513
Prepare to sortie.

84
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:15,515
Sortie?!

85
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:18,518
But Unit 00 is still frozen!

86
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:22,522
Unless... You intend to use Unit 01?

87
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,027
There is no other choice.

88
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,030
Ikari Shinji-kun.

89
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,033
Y--Yes?

90
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:29,535
You will pilot it.

91
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:37,544
Father, why did you call me here?

92
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:39,547
You know why.

93
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:44,049
So, you want me to step into this and fight that thing outside?

94
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:45,055
Exactly.

95
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:48,057
No, I won't! Not after all this time!

96
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,561
For so long I've thought you didn't care about me!

97
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:53,565
I called you because I need you.

98
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:57,571
Why me?

99
00:08:57,574 --> 00:09:00,074
Because no one else can.

100
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:02,077
I can't do it...

101
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,080
I've never seen or heard of this thing. It's impossible!

102
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:07,585
You'll learn to.

103
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:12,088
No... I can't do it!

104
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,094
I can't pilot this!

105
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:18,096
If you're going to pilot it, do it now. Otherwise get out!

106
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:27,108
The bastard has found his way here.

107
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:33,116
Shinji-kun, there isn't much time.

108
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:38,623
Pilot it!

109
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,625
No...

110
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:44,629
After coming all this way, this is ridiculous!

111
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:49,133
Shinji-kun, why did you come here?

112
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,140
Don't run away. From your father, and above all, from yourself!

113
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:59,145
I know! But, I can't do it!

114
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:08,658
Fuyutsuki.

115
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,160
Wake up Rei.

116
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:12,163
Can we use her?

117
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,666
She's not dead.

118
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:15,669
Understood.

119
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:18,173
Rei.

120
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:19,175
Yes.

121
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:21,678
The spare is useless. You'll have to go one more time.

122
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:22,681
Yes.

123
00:10:25,185 --> 00:10:29,185
Restart Unit 01's core unit to L-00 Type.

124
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,690
Roger, discontinuing current process. Begining reformat.

125
00:10:34,696 --> 00:10:38,696
I'm useless again... As expected...

126
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:21,743
Are you okay?!

127
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:42,262
I can't run away, I can't run away, I can't run away, I can't run away...

128
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,767
I can't run away!

129
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:47,271
I'll do it. I'll pilot it.

130
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:51,777
Freezing process has been halted.

131
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,280
Flywheel rotation has stopped. Connections have been released.

132
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:56,283
No problems with auxillary voltage.

133
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,287
Stoplight plug draining complete.

134
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,290
Roger, inserting Entry Plug.

135
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:04,293
Spinal conduction system opened, connection established.

136
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:09,301
Probe needle driving in.

137
00:12:09,304 --> 00:12:12,304
Prime synch established. Analyzing nerve connections.

138
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:15,307
Reading of -0.051% within limitations.

139
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,310
-The plug has been fixed.
-Roger, starting first contact.

140
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:23,318
Flooding Entry Plug.

141
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:26,321
Hey, what is th--

142
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:29,326
It's alright.

143
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:33,329
Once the LCL fills your lungs, it will provide oxygen directly to your blood.

144
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,333
You'll get used to it.

145
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:38,837
Master power source connection complete.

146
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,840
Roger.

147
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,342
Starting second contact.

148
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,844
Establishing interface.

149
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,350
No problems detected in A10 nervous system.

150
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:49,853
LCL levels nominal.

151
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:53,855
Japanese has been fixed as the primary mode of operation.

152
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,860
No problems detected with initial contacts.

153
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:58,365
Communication lines open.

154
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:04,868
Risk 1405 all clear. Synapse reading: Synchro rate 41.3%

155
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,875
Plug suit auxilary support functioning perfectly... Amazing.

156
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,379
Harmonics are in normal levels. Everything's under control.

157
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:13,885
This will work!

158
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:15,388
Prepare to launch!

159
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:19,892
Release 1st lock bolt!

160
00:13:20,896 --> 00:13:22,396
1st lock released.

161
00:13:22,398 --> 00:13:24,398
Transfering umbilical bridge.

162
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:28,403
Release 2nd lock bolt!

163
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:32,408
Removing the first restraint.

164
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,912
Removing the second restraint.

165
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:42,921
Cancel safety devices 1 through 15.

166
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:45,924
Safety devices canceled. Unit 01 is free.

167
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:47,928
Internal power supply charge complete.

168
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:50,432
No problems detected with external power supply.

169
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:53,435
Understood. Evangelion Unit 01 transfering to launch pad.

170
00:13:53,439 --> 00:14:10,439
BALLSBALLSBALLS

171
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,460
The course is clear. All green!

172
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:18,464
Launch preparations complete.

173
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:19,966
Understood.

174
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:21,969
Are you sure?

175
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:22,972
Of course.

176
00:14:22,974 --> 00:14:26,474
We must defeat the Angels, or we will all die here.

177
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:29,979
Ikari, are you really okay with this?

178
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:32,485
Launch!

179
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,511
Are you ready, Shinji-kun?

180
00:14:58,514 --> 00:14:59,514
Y--yeah.

181
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:01,516
Release the final safety lock!

182
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,020
Evangelion Unit 01, lift off!

183
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:11,527
Shinji-kun, focus only on walking now.

184
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:14,032
Walk...

185
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:23,042
It walked!

186
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:27,547
Walk...

187
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:39,059
Shinji-kun, get up!

188
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,063
Hurry, get up right now!

189
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,578
Shinji-kun, calm down!

190
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,580
That isn't your arm!

191
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:01,086
How is the Evangelion's defense system?

192
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:02,589
I can't get a signal.

193
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:03,591
The field isn't developing.

194
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:04,593
No good?!

195
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:09,349
The left arm has been fractured!

196
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,401
The circuits have snapped!

197
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,105
Shinji-kun, dodge it!

198
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:21,614
The frontal cranium has been cracked!

199
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:23,116
The armor can't withstand much more!

200
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:35,629
Skull fracture! Damage unknown!

201
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,633
Activity halted!

202
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:38,635
What is the status?

203
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:41,137
Synchro graph inverting, pulse-flow is reversing!

204
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:42,641
Cut the circuits!

205
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:45,643
It's no good--The signal is being rejected! It's not connecting!

206
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:46,647
What about Shinji-kun?!

207
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,650
No response from the monitoring system. Life signs unknown!

208
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:50,652
Unit 01 is completely silent.

209
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:51,656
Misato!

210
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:53,157
It's come to this...

211
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Halt military operations! The pilot's life is our main priority!

212
00:16:56,164 --> 00:16:57,664
Eject the plug by force!

213
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:00,167
It's no good! It's not responding!

214
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,170
What is this?!

215
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,180
Eva is restarting!

216
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:12,181
Impossible... how is it moving?

217
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:14,186
It can't be...

218
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:15,688
It's gone berserk...

219
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,210
Looks like we've won.

220
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,219
A.T. field?!

221
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:46,721
It's no good, the A.T. field is at it's limit!

222
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,225
Eva can't even touch the Angel!

223
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:56,734
Left arm restored!

224
00:17:56,737 --> 00:17:57,737
Incredible...

225
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:05,242
Unit 01 is expanding it's own A.T. field! It's neutralizing phase space!

226
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:07,247
No, it's eroding the Angel's own A.T. field.

227
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:14,755
To destroy it's A.T. field so easily...

228
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,565
What is Eva's status?

229
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,830
That is Eva's...

230
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,333
True form...

231
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,842
Have you decided on a name?

232
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:42,346
If it's a boy, Shinji. If it's a girl, then Rei.

233
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:44,851
Shinji... Rei...

234
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:51,858
Shinji... Shinji... Ayanami...

235
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:57,864
Shinji... Rei... Rei...

236
00:19:58,871 --> 00:20:01,871
Ikari... Rei...

237
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,875
No... Ayanami...

238
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Rei!

239
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:29,903
An unknown ceiling.

240
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:40,913
If the fourth Angel attacked us now, we would be annihilated.

241
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:45,918
Not to mention it was the Third Child who was there for Unit 01's first start-up.

242
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:48,423
Just more of the same, am I right?

243
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:52,427
Repairing Unit 01 is a huge unexpected cost.

244
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:56,432
Compared to a frozen Unit 00, that is hardly a problem.

245
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:59,436
Eva Unit 01's recovery operation is complete.

246
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,441
It is currently locked in cage 6.

247
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:04,944
A 10 day examination is planned.

248
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:09,948
-Is there an internal record from it's berzerker period?
-It was functioning at zero capacity. Nothing was written.

249
00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:12,955
We'll get the results in cryptogenics I suppose.

250
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:15,209
Eva's certainly an effective weapon...

251
00:21:15,212 --> 00:21:17,212
A little overkill, don't you think?

252
00:21:17,215 --> 00:21:22,215
Inconveniences aside, Unit 01 should have performed at least until the fifth Angel.

253
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,970
Don't worry. Unit 01 is not our only weapon.

254
00:21:25,975 --> 00:21:30,475
Unit 02's pilot is currently being evaluated in Germany.

255
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,480
The construction of Unit 03 is also progressing as planned.

256
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:36,985
Overseeing NERV and Eva with discretion is your primary duty.

257
00:21:36,989 --> 00:21:39,989
We will not stand for any repeated disappointments.

258
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:44,493
That's right. To exterminate the Angels is but one step in fulfilling our contract with Lilith.

259
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:50,499
To execute the Human Instrumentality Project is our final wish.

260
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:54,505
I understand. Everything will go according to Seele's scenario.

261
00:22:20,536 --> 00:22:24,536
The complete collapse of the Angel's A.T. field was far beyond our expectations.

262
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:28,542
The blood is like a lake from hell... It reminds me of the Second Impact.

263
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,547
It makes me sick.

264
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:36,049
For Eva to defeat the Angels is the only hope left for humanity.

265
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:39,556
It's the pilot who carries the burden of that hope.

266
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:18,598
Alone?

267
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Yes, his room is in Block 6. I assume that isn't a problem.

268
00:23:23,607 --> 00:23:24,607
That's fine.

269
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:26,609
Is that really okay, Shinji-kun?

270
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:29,111
It's okay, I prefer being alone.

271
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,616
It's always the same wherever I am.

272
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,119
What did you say?!

273
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:37,622
Like I was saying, Shinji-kun would be much better off at my place.

274
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:43,126
Besides, I have authorization from above.
Don't worry, it's not like I'll have my hands all over him.

275
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:46,633
That goes without saying! If that's supposed to be...

276
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:49,138
I was just kidding, jeez...

277
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:54,644
Alright, looks like we're having a party tonight!

278
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,648
What for?

279
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,150
A welcoming party of course! You're a new member of the family.

280
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:04,658
Ah, so you're going to move?

281
00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:10,161
Yes, I never thought this city would become a battlefield.

282
00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:15,168
Really! My husband said we should evacuate soon.

283
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:19,173
Just today, over 100 people left the city.

284
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:25,178
No matter how powerful a fortress this city is, those NERV people still don't know what they're doing.

285
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:29,186
Just thinking about yesterday makes me shudder...

286
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,690
I know...

287
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:38,196
Oh yeah, we'll be making a quick stop on the way.

288
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:40,201
Where to?

289
00:24:40,205 --> 00:24:41,705
A really cool place.

290
00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:51,213
The city is deserted.

291
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:54,219
It's time.

292
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:31,755
Amazing... The buildings are rising up!

293
00:25:49,778 --> 00:25:55,278
This is our stronghold against the onslaught of the Angels: Tokyo-3.

294
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:57,785
This is our city.

295
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,290
This is the city you protected.

296
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:13,301
I think your things have already been delivered.

297
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:17,306
To be honest, I've only moved here recently.

298
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:19,811
Alright, come on in.

299
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:23,815
Sorry for disturbing you. (Ojamashimasu)

300
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,320
Shinji-kun, this is your home now.

301
00:26:34,831 --> 00:26:36,831
I--I'm home. (Tadaima)

302
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:38,834
Welcome home. (Okaerinasai)

303
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,840
Ah, it's a little messy in here. Don't you mind that.

304
00:26:46,346 --> 00:26:48,346
A little...

305
00:26:48,348 --> 00:26:49,348
Messy?

306
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:52,351
Oh sorry, there should be some food in the refrigerator.

307
00:26:52,355 --> 00:26:53,855
O--Okay!

308
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:56,358
Ice...

309
00:26:56,361 --> 00:26:58,361
Junk food...

310
00:26:58,363 --> 00:27:00,363
Endless beer...

311
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:02,867
What kind of life does she lead?

312
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:06,871
-Itadakimasu!
-Itadakimasu.

313
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,884
Ah! I live for this!

314
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:25,391
Not hungry? For instant food, it's pretty good.

315
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:29,897
Ah, well... I'm just not used to this sort of meal.

316
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:32,901
No way! You can't be so picky!

317
00:27:32,905 --> 00:27:37,405
Uhhh, no, that's not it... Ummm...

318
00:27:37,911 --> 00:27:40,411
Pretty fun, huh?

319
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:42,415
Having a meal with another person?

320
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,419
Y--yeah.

321
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:50,922
Alright! Since this is your home now, you have to act like it!

322
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:52,929
Okay.

323
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:56,931
Come on... "Yes, yes, yes, yes." Don't be so boring!

324
00:27:56,937 --> 00:28:00,937
You're a boy aren't you?! Pull yourself together!

325
00:28:01,442 --> 00:28:02,942
Okay.

326
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:08,944
Well, whatever. Go take a bath and wash away all that negativity.

327
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:11,452
Bathing is laundry of life!

328
00:28:20,964 --> 00:28:22,464
Misato-san!

329
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,967
What?

330
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:32,974
Ah, him? He's a hot-weather penguin. Sort of a friend of mine.

331
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:42,987
That penguin lives here?!

332
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,990
I've had him for 15 years. His name is Pen-pen.

333
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:50,495
He's another member of the family.

334
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:53,501
Anyway... Shouldn't you be hiding that?

335
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:05,011
A little obvious, don't you think? Maybe I'm the one who'll be seen through...

336
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:09,519
Katsuragi Misato-san...

337
00:29:10,523 --> 00:29:12,523
She's not a bad person.

338
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:14,526
Bathing is the laundry of life!

339
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,030
In here, more bad memories come up than others.

340
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:23,036
How is Rei's current state?

341
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:27,041
Noon... Did you go to the hospital?

342
00:29:28,546 --> 00:29:33,046
There are no problems. We will prepare to re-start the frozen Unit 00.

343
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:37,552
How is your son? His mental state must be very unstable.

344
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:43,058
He's been released. Still, his condition is a good excuse to cancel the freezing on Unit 00.

345
00:29:43,063 --> 00:29:46,063
Yes... It was Captain Katsuragi's proposal after all.

346
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:05,083
Even without a preliminary report, they suddenly elected three boys.

347
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:09,087
All of this corresponding with the Angel's attack.

348
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:13,092
In addition, forcibly confiscating Commander Ikari's son.

349
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:16,097
Certainly there must be some resentment.

350
00:30:16,101 --> 00:30:21,101
Even knowing the Angel has been defeated, I feel suprisingly...

351
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:23,609
Unhappy.

352
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:29,115
Another unknown ceiling...

353
00:30:29,618 --> 00:30:31,618
It feels natural.

354
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,621
Because I don't know anything of this city.

355
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,125
This is your home now.

356
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,129
Why am I here?

357
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:57,147
Shinji-kun? I'm coming in.

358
00:31:00,154 --> 00:31:03,154
I forgot to tell you something.

359
00:31:03,158 --> 00:31:06,658
You did a good thing.

360
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:08,662
You should be proud.

361
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,165
Good-night, Shinji-kun.

362
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,669
Cheer up.

363
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:23,678
Sorry, exchange student. I have to hit you.

364
00:31:23,683 --> 00:31:26,183
I just won't be satisfied if I don't.

365
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:31,687
Real sorry. That guy's little sister was injured in that big incident the other day.

366
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,194
Or, something like that.

367
00:31:35,198 --> 00:31:38,198
It's not like I piloted it because I wanted to.

368
00:31:58,222 --> 00:32:01,222
Where are the people who praise me, I wonder...

369
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:05,226
If it was such a good thing to pilot Eva, why am I getting hit?

370
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:12,237
Are you ready, Shinji-kun?

371
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:13,239
Yes.

372
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:16,241
Within the Angel is a central core.

373
00:32:16,245 --> 00:32:21,245
Destroying the core is the only way to destroy the Angel's physical form.

374
00:32:23,253 --> 00:32:27,253
Therefore, always aim for the center, and squeeze the switch.

375
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:33,761
We will work on accuracy. You will remember the sensation when the time comes.

376
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:34,765
Yes.

377
00:32:39,773 --> 00:32:43,773
Good. We will continue practice with this Induction Mode.

378
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:44,778
Yes.

379
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:54,786
Shinji-kun sure has brought himself around to piloting Eva, hasn't he?

380
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,791
He does whatever people tell him to.

381
00:32:56,793 --> 00:32:59,293
It's how he goes through life.

382
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:13,799
Aim at center target, switch... Aim at center target, switch...

383
00:33:16,816 --> 00:33:18,316
Which reminds me...

384
00:33:18,318 --> 00:33:21,318
Shinji-kun was hit by a student at his new school.

385
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:23,822
Is his security detail working alright?

386
00:33:23,826 --> 00:33:26,826
There's no problem with the secret agency's surveillance.

387
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:28,829
Besides, it wasn't very bad.

388
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:32,833
It was better for there to be no outside interference.

389
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:34,838
Doesn't he live with you?

390
00:33:34,841 --> 00:33:37,341
His care is your responsibility too, you know.

391
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:39,344
It's for that reason.

392
00:33:39,347 --> 00:33:42,347
It's difficult... He's just too naive.

393
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:43,851
Is that a complaint?

394
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:46,354
You were the one who was so adamant about taking him in.

395
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,857
Shut up...

396
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:59,364
Well, he doesn't have much of a personality for making friends.

397
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:02,873
Have you heard of the "Hedgehog's dilema?"

398
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:05,877
Hedgehog? The little prickly things?

399
00:34:05,881 --> 00:34:09,881
If a hedgehog wants to be close with other hedgehogs...

400
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:14,886
The closer they become, the more they hurt eachother.

401
00:34:14,891 --> 00:34:18,391
People are the same way.

402
00:34:18,396 --> 00:34:20,396
The same is true of Shinji-kun.

403
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,399
The more pain his heart endures, the more afraid he becomes.

404
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,410
Well, eventually he'll realize.

405
00:34:32,414 --> 00:34:37,914
Growing up means being hurt whether you're close with others...

406
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,420
or if they're kept at a distance.

407
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:44,926
I suppose you're right.

408
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:50,930
Still, when will we get the B-Section equipment repair estimate?

409
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:53,936
Eva's maintenance and battle capacity is their main priority.

410
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,440
Money isn't a problem.

411
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:57,942
My butt is freezing...

412
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:09,455
An emergency call...

413
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,458
I'll go on ahead.

414
00:35:25,474 --> 00:35:27,474
The object has been visually identified.

415
00:35:27,477 --> 00:35:29,477
E747 has also confirmed the object.

416
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,980
Analysis indicates Pattern Blue. There's no doubt--it's the fifth Angel.

417
00:35:32,984 --> 00:35:35,484
All hands to Stage One Battle Stations.

418
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:37,989
Roger. Preparing anti-aircraft measures.

419
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:40,492
Tokyo-3 transforming to battle formation.

420
00:35:42,998 --> 00:35:45,498
Initiating Central Block.

421
00:36:38,054 --> 00:36:42,054
Districts 1 through 7 of Central Block transfered.

422
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:45,059
Notification to all government ministries completed.

423
00:36:45,063 --> 00:36:46,563
Target is steadily progressing.

424
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:50,066
All anti-aircraft systems currently functioning at 48%.

425
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,570
What is the status of civilians and noncombatants?

426
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:55,574
Reports confirm they've already been evacuated to shelters.

427
00:36:56,078 --> 00:37:01,578
All junior and primary students, please stay with your designated...

428
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:06,586
At it again?

429
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:09,591
There's only letters on the screen again.

430
00:37:09,593 --> 00:37:12,093
It's an information blackout. They won't show us regular citizens anything.

431
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:14,097
Even if this is a big event.

432
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:24,109
They're just wasting tax money...

433
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:27,611
In this world, people don't care how many bullets are fired.

434
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:31,616
The Japanese government is demanding we send out an Evangelion.

435
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,120
How annoying. They don't have to tell us.

436
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:40,125
Starting Entry Plug. LCL levels nominal...

437
00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:43,631
Father isn't even here. Why am I piloting this again?

438
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,637
Even getting hit over it.

439
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:53,644
Hey, I wanna talk to you about something.

440
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:56,148
-What about?
-Come here.

441
00:37:56,152 --> 00:37:57,652
Alright...

442
00:37:57,655 --> 00:37:59,155
Yeah, yeah! That's what I thought.

443
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:01,157
-Class Rep!
-What?

444
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:03,661
We both have to go to the bathroom, apparently.

445
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:05,664
Come on, you had your chance earlier!

446
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,168
So, what's this about?

447
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,170
Before I die, I'm going to see at least one of them.

448
00:38:11,174 --> 00:38:12,674
That battle up there?

449
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:16,676
It's the real thing! Who knows when the next enemy will come here...

450
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:19,181
Kensuke, you're nuts.

451
00:38:19,686 --> 00:38:22,686
If I miss this chance, I might never get another!

452
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:25,690
Come on... Just help me open the gate.

453
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:30,194
Guess I've got no choice. You sure don't give in, do you?

454
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:35,702
Shinji-kun, are you ready to sortie?

455
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:36,705
...Yes.

456
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:41,208
Good. To neutralize the enemy's A.T. field will require rapid, simultaneous fire.

457
00:38:41,213 --> 00:38:43,713
Just like in practice. You'll be fine.

458
00:38:43,717 --> 00:38:44,717
...Yes.

459
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,719
Launch!

460
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:03,736
Incredible! This was worth the trouble!

461
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,240
Just in time!

462
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:12,749
It's here.

463
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:17,253
-Aim at center target, switch...
-A.T. field is developing.

464
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:19,756
-Just as planned. Are you ready, Shinji-kun?
-Yes.

465
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:20,759
Yes.

466
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,269
Idiot! The smoke is conceling the enemy!

467
00:39:44,787 --> 00:39:46,787
Looks like it got him.

468
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,290
He'll be alright.

469
00:39:48,293 --> 00:39:49,793
We're sending up a reserve rifle!

470
00:39:50,796 --> 00:39:52,296
Take it!

471
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:55,799
Shinji-kun...? Shinji-kun?!

472
00:39:55,803 --> 00:39:59,803
Oh man... That hit really knocked him out.

473
00:39:59,808 --> 00:40:01,308
Sh--Shut up!

474
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,830
Umbillical Cable has been disconnected!

475
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:24,333
Eva switching to internal power!

476
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:27,335
Active time remaining is 4 minutes 53 seconds!

477
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:34,345
It's coming this way!

478
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:40,851
Shinji-kun, are you alright?! Shinji-kun!

479
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,855
-Can he hear me?
-No problems detected. It should run!

480
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,868
Shinji-kun's classmates?!

481
00:40:54,871 --> 00:40:56,371
What are they doing there?!

482
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:06,882
Why won't he fight it?!

483
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:10,143
Because we're here... He can't move!

484
00:41:10,147 --> 00:41:13,647
Unit 01 will reach active time limit in 3 minutes 28 seconds!

485
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:16,651
Contact with outer surface, damage at 58%!

486
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,160
Shinji-kun, let those two into the cockpit!

487
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:27,665
Once they're in, get out of there! We'll regroup later!

488
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:32,672
You two, get in!

489
00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:36,177
What? There's water!

490
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:38,679
-The camera!
-Entry Plug restarting.

491
00:41:42,687 --> 00:41:45,687
Penetrating through third protection film!

492
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:55,199
Now! Retreat!

493
00:41:59,706 --> 00:42:02,206
Take recovery route 34. Head to the mountain's eastern side!

494
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:04,709
Hey exchange student, she said, "Run away!"

495
00:42:04,713 --> 00:42:05,713
Exchange student!

496
00:42:05,715 --> 00:42:08,215
I can't run away... I can't run away...

497
00:42:11,722 --> 00:42:13,222
Progressive Knife equipped!

498
00:42:15,727 --> 00:42:18,227
Shinji-kun, listen to me! Fall back now!

499
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,230
Shinji-kun!

500
00:42:24,738 --> 00:42:25,738
That idiot!

501
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:47,759
Unit 01 will reach active time limit in 30 seconds.

502
00:42:47,763 --> 00:42:50,763
28, 27, 26...

503
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:55,767
25, 24, 23, 22...

504
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:03,276
13, 12, 11, 10, 9...

505
00:43:03,282 --> 00:43:08,282
8, 7, 6, 5, 4...

506
00:43:08,288 --> 00:43:11,288
3, 2, 1...

507
00:43:19,801 --> 00:43:22,301
Eva Unit 01 has ceased all activity.

508
00:43:22,304 --> 00:43:24,804
The target has completely collapsed.

509
00:44:04,847 --> 00:44:07,347
Why did you ignore my orders?

510
00:44:07,351 --> 00:44:08,851
I'm sorry.

511
00:44:08,853 --> 00:44:11,353
I'm the one responsible for this military operation, correct?

512
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,857
Yes.

513
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:15,859
When I give you an order, it is your duty to follow them.

514
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:16,863
Do you understand me?

515
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:18,866
Yes.

516
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:20,869
Make this the last time.

517
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:22,371
Yes.

518
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,875
Do you really understand what I'm telling you?

519
00:44:25,878 --> 00:44:28,378
Yes, I understand Misato-san.

520
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:31,883
It's fine, we won didn't we?

521
00:44:32,387 --> 00:44:35,887
If you tell me to pilot Eva, I will.

522
00:44:49,405 --> 00:44:52,905
That's enough. Go back and get some rest.

523
00:46:05,983 --> 00:46:07,483
He has no intention of coming back.

524
00:46:07,486 --> 00:46:08,986
That idiot.

525
00:46:59,038 --> 00:47:01,538
Ikari, Ikari Shinji.

526
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:05,041
Absent so soon after transfering...

527
00:47:05,046 --> 00:47:09,046
Well regardless, let's continue yesterday's test.

528
00:47:49,091 --> 00:47:51,091
That's enough...

529
00:47:52,094 --> 00:47:55,094
Just go back to Misato-san!

530
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:19,619
Did walking around for days cheer you up, Ikari Shinji-kun?

531
00:48:23,628 --> 00:48:27,628
Not really. It doesn't matter what I do.

532
00:48:29,134 --> 00:48:31,134
I'm not free to do anything.

533
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,140
Anyway, I have to pilot Eva, don't I?

534
00:48:36,144 --> 00:48:38,644
It's the only reason my father called me here.

535
00:48:39,649 --> 00:48:42,149
Fine. I'll pilot it.

536
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:45,152
If that's what everyone wants, that's what I'll do.

537
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:48,156
What everyone wants...? What do you want?

538
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,160
It doesn't matter what I want... Everyone knows it.

539
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:56,666
Father, Misato-san, even an injured Ayanami...

540
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,170
Cut it out!

541
00:48:58,173 --> 00:49:00,673
This has nothing to do with anyone else!

542
00:49:00,676 --> 00:49:04,176
You decide whether you continue to pilot Eva!

543
00:49:04,681 --> 00:49:07,181
If you want to leave this terrible place, fine!

544
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:10,185
Everyone has free will. Do as you please!

545
00:49:15,194 --> 00:49:19,194
Eventually your son will act as planned.

546
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,200
Yes. Next we will have Rei move in closer to him.

547
00:49:24,205 --> 00:49:26,205
The plan has not changed.

548
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:29,208
A 14 year old scenario...

549
00:49:29,212 --> 00:49:32,212
Our fate rests on children.

550
00:49:33,217 --> 00:49:34,717
Isn't it a bit cruel?

551
00:49:41,226 --> 00:49:44,226
Let's stop right there--Go ahead and hit me!

552
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:47,230
I won't feel satisfied if you don't.

553
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:50,235
Well, seeing as he's so sincere, I'd go for it.

554
00:49:57,746 --> 00:50:01,746
Now we're even. I'm sorry for hitting you, Ikari.

555
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:16,263
Go for it, Tayoko!

556
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:24,772
Hey, they're looking over here!

557
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:28,276
Suzuhara has a weird look in his eyes.

558
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:30,281
Ikari-kun!

559
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:35,285
Ayanami Rei, age 14.

560
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:39,290
She was the first candidate chosen by the Marduk Report.

561
00:50:39,295 --> 00:50:41,295
The First Child.

562
00:50:41,297 --> 00:50:45,797
Specifically, she is the exclusive pilot of the experimental Evangelion Unit 00.

563
00:50:45,803 --> 00:50:49,303
Her personal history is non-existant. Everything has been erased.

564
00:50:49,808 --> 00:50:52,808
Why did my father rescue her?

565
00:50:53,312 --> 00:50:55,312
Start-up system corrupted!

566
00:50:55,315 --> 00:51:01,315
-Problem detected in Stage 3.
-Nervous system elements rejected.

567
00:51:01,323 --> 00:51:04,323
Pulse-flow is reversing! Unable to stop it!

568
00:51:04,326 --> 00:51:06,326
Direct monitoring disrupted.

569
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:09,329
Entry Plug in unstable depths, Eva is refusing to release it!

570
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:12,833
Halt all contacts. Break circuits 1 through 6.

571
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:15,338
It's no good, the signal isn't connecting!

572
00:51:16,343 --> 00:51:18,343
Eva Unit 00 is out of control!

573
00:51:18,345 --> 00:51:20,345
Stop the experiment. Cut all power.

574
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:21,349
Yes sir!

575
00:51:27,357 --> 00:51:29,357
Unit 00 is currently on reserve power.

576
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,859
Complete shut-down in 35 seconds!

577
00:51:31,862 --> 00:51:33,862
Suspension in process.

578
00:51:40,372 --> 00:51:42,372
It's dangerous! Step back!

579
00:51:43,877 --> 00:51:45,877
Auto-ejection system engaging!

580
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,880
Damn it!

581
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:55,389
Quickly, release the bakelite!

582
00:51:56,392 --> 00:51:57,392
Rei!

583
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:03,398
Complete shut-down in 10 seconds!

584
00:52:03,401 --> 00:52:07,401
8, 7, 6, 5...

585
00:52:07,406 --> 00:52:11,406
4, 3, 2, 1.

586
00:52:13,413 --> 00:52:15,413
Unit 00 has ceased all activity.

587
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:31,430
Rei! Are you okay?!

588
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:33,434
Rei!

589
00:52:37,941 --> 00:52:38,941
Good.

590
00:52:44,448 --> 00:52:46,448
It's rather unbelievable isn't it?

591
00:52:46,451 --> 00:52:50,951
Despite the official report having been eliminated, it's not so hard to understand.

592
00:52:50,957 --> 00:52:54,457
After The berzerker incident, Unit 00 is suddenly unfrozen.

593
00:52:54,461 --> 00:52:55,961
Isn't that a bit hasty?

594
00:52:55,964 --> 00:53:00,964
Another Angel suddenly appeared. Our combat readiness is an urgent priority.

595
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,470
I suppose that's true...

596
00:53:03,474 --> 00:53:05,974
Rei's re-start test has already been authorized.

597
00:53:04,976 --> 00:53:08,476
Using Unit 00 won't be a problem.

598
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:12,481
If we repair a few nerve connections...

599
00:53:12,485 --> 00:53:15,485
Immediate re-deployment, right?

600
00:53:19,494 --> 00:53:20,994
Ayanami...

601
00:53:20,996 --> 00:53:23,996
Why is she always alone?

602
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:56,529
Understood. Synchro Test, Program 508 complete.

603
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:58,534
Shinji-kun, good job today.

604
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:03,039
Well, how is living together with him?

605
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:05,042
So-so. It'll take some getting used to.

606
00:54:05,045 --> 00:54:07,045
Is there any leftover tension?

607
00:54:07,048 --> 00:54:09,548
It's your first time living with a man, isn't it?

608
00:54:11,053 --> 00:54:13,053
This isn't like 8 years ago.

609
00:54:13,056 --> 00:54:15,056
"Love" isn't involved this time...

610
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,560
I wonder... Shinji-kun did stay because of you.

611
00:54:20,065 --> 00:54:21,565
You're wrong.

612
00:54:22,569 --> 00:54:25,069
I think... he stayed because of his father.

613
00:54:26,574 --> 00:54:30,074
He only wants just one word of praise.

614
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:36,079
He's so lonely... he only needs a little affection.

615
00:54:38,087 --> 00:54:41,087
He's a very distant man... like your father.

616
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:47,094
Why does he pay so little attention to him...

617
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,099
And he seems to speak only to Rei.

618
00:54:50,102 --> 00:54:51,602
It's a terrible balance.

619
00:54:51,605 --> 00:54:55,605
Men nowadays don't seem very interested in me either.

620
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:58,610
It's not a very good time for women.

621
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:05,109
Well, then... It's time we get back.

622
00:55:05,114 --> 00:55:07,614
A worker bee as usual.

623
00:55:08,118 --> 00:55:12,118
Misato. Here is Shinji-kun's official security card...

624
00:55:12,123 --> 00:55:16,623
...and Ayanami Rei's renewed card. They were delivered some time ago.

625
00:55:16,629 --> 00:55:19,629
Tomorrow, give them both to Shinji-kun, would you?

626
00:55:21,134 --> 00:55:22,634
I guess so.

627
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:27,139
Ayanami Rei...

628
00:55:32,147 --> 00:55:34,647
Why was my father laughing?

629
00:55:35,652 --> 00:55:37,652
Why doesn't he laugh with me?

630
00:56:07,685 --> 00:56:09,685
Excuse me...

631
00:56:13,192 --> 00:56:15,692
Excuse me, it's Ikari!

632
00:56:17,197 --> 00:56:19,197
Ayanami, I'm coming in!

633
00:56:55,236 --> 00:56:57,236
Ayanami's?

634
00:57:11,252 --> 00:57:12,752
Ummm...

635
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:16,757
I wasn't trying to...

636
00:57:49,793 --> 00:57:51,793
Could you move?

637
00:58:13,819 --> 00:58:15,319
What is it?

638
00:58:16,322 --> 00:58:18,322
Ummm, I...

639
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:26,830
I was supposed to...

640
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:28,834
The uhhh...

641
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:33,838
The card! The card was renewed and... that's why I...

642
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:40,346
That's why I... I wasn't trying to...

643
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:51,358
Ritsuko-san gave it to me because she forgot... It's the truth.

644
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:55,862
No one answered when I rang, and I had a key...

645
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:11,381
Central Dogma is currently open.

646
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:14,385
Group 3 through Communication Gate 4 please.

647
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:22,892
Here's your new card. Ritsuko-san left it with me.

648
00:59:30,405 --> 00:59:32,905
I'm sorry for what I did.

649
00:59:32,908 --> 00:59:34,408
What about?

650
00:59:38,415 --> 00:59:41,415
Aren't you afraid, Ayanami?

651
00:59:41,419 --> 00:59:43,919
Getting into that Evangelion again...

652
00:59:45,423 --> 00:59:46,923
Why?

653
00:59:47,426 --> 00:59:52,426
I heard you got hurt in that test... Are you going to be okay?

654
00:59:56,436 --> 00:59:58,436
Yes. I'll be okay.

655
00:59:58,438 --> 01:00:02,938
But... Won't you be afraid when you see those berzerk eyes again?

656
01:00:02,944 --> 01:00:06,444
If we lose to the Angels, we'll all die...

657
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:10,951
You're Commander Ikari's son, aren't you?

658
01:00:12,456 --> 01:00:15,456
You don't trust your father's work?

659
01:00:15,961 --> 01:00:18,961
Of course not! He's not much of a father...

660
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:47,991
Unidentified object analysis complete.

661
01:00:47,994 --> 01:00:49,994
Compiling data.

662
01:00:49,997 --> 01:00:52,497
Pattern blue. Angel confirmed.

663
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,500
As we thought. The 6th Angel.

664
01:00:55,003 --> 01:00:56,503
Yes.

665
01:00:56,506 --> 01:00:58,506
Prepare to sortie Unit 01.

666
01:00:59,009 --> 01:01:01,509
Evangelion Unit 01, prepare to launch.

667
01:01:01,514 --> 01:01:03,514
Moving to cage 1 runway.

668
01:01:06,018 --> 01:01:08,518
The target has cleared Lake Ashinoko.

669
01:01:07,521 --> 01:01:10,521
Evangelion Unit 01 is ready to launch.

670
01:01:10,525 --> 01:01:11,525
Launch!

671
01:01:20,536 --> 01:01:22,286
High energy reaction detected inside the target!

672
01:01:22,288 --> 01:01:23,288
What?!

673
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:24,291
Impossible!

674
01:01:27,096 --> 01:01:28,346
Get out of there!

675
01:01:47,116 --> 01:01:49,116
Synchro rate dropped to 00%.

676
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,620
Raise protective armor!

677
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:15,145
Withdraw attack! Recover Eva Unit 01 immediately!

678
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:18,148
It's no good! The catapult is melting--it's unusable!

679
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:19,152
What about the A.T. field?

680
01:02:19,154 --> 01:02:22,654
It's expanded to the limit, it's barely maintaining!

681
01:02:27,663 --> 01:02:30,163
No! No, I can't!

682
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:33,167
Take me out--take me out, father!

683
01:02:33,171 --> 01:02:34,671
We're breaking military protocal!

684
01:02:34,674 --> 01:02:37,174
The pilot's life is our main priority! Force eject the plug!

685
01:02:37,177 --> 01:02:38,677
You can't.

686
01:02:40,181 --> 01:02:44,681
If the pilot is taken out, the A.T. field will completely collapse!

687
01:02:44,686 --> 01:02:47,686
I know this is extremely hard to bear.

688
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:48,690
But...

689
01:02:55,699 --> 01:02:58,199
Enough of this...

690
01:02:58,203 --> 01:03:01,703
Force recover the fuselage! Ignite the blasting bolt!

691
01:03:23,229 --> 01:03:24,729
The target has ceased fire.

692
01:03:24,731 --> 01:03:28,731
-Recover Unit 01. Take first-aid to the cage!
-Put the rescue squad on stand-by!

693
01:03:28,736 --> 01:03:30,736
Plug LCL coolant at it's highest level.

694
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,740
Pilot confirmed. Heartbeat is very weak!

695
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:35,742
Set plug suit life support to maximum. Begin heart massage!

696
01:03:35,746 --> 01:03:36,746
Yes, sir!

697
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:40,751
Pulse confirmed!

698
01:03:40,754 --> 01:03:42,254
Force expel the plug!

699
01:03:42,256 --> 01:03:45,756
LCL drain in progress.

700
01:03:46,261 --> 01:03:48,261
-Begin emergency LCL draining!
-Yes, sir!

701
01:03:50,266 --> 01:03:51,766
Treat him, quickly!

702
01:04:30,308 --> 01:04:32,808
The target is currently invading from above.

703
01:04:32,811 --> 01:04:35,311
It is burrowing into the Geofront.

704
01:04:35,314 --> 01:04:39,314
He's aiming to attack NERV Headquarters directly...

705
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:42,820
Well then, every department report in.

706
01:04:43,324 --> 01:04:45,324
Judging from the previous battle...

707
01:04:44,326 --> 01:04:49,326
...the target seems to automatically fire on any foreign object within it's space.

708
01:04:49,332 --> 01:04:52,832
Then Eva won't be able to attack it directly...

709
01:04:52,837 --> 01:04:54,337
How is it's A.T. field?

710
01:04:54,339 --> 01:04:56,339
Active. To make matters worse...

711
01:04:56,343 --> 01:05:00,343
...it has the ability to change phase space for external protection.

712
01:05:00,348 --> 01:05:02,348
Neutralizing it will be very difficult.

713
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:06,350
Magi estimates that N2 Mines may pass through...

714
01:05:06,355 --> 01:05:11,855
...it's A.T. field and cause unnecessary damage to NERV Headquarters.

715
01:05:12,863 --> 01:05:15,863
Magi 2 in Matsushiro has made the same conclusion.

716
01:05:16,868 --> 01:05:21,868
Presently, the Japanese Government and U.N. forces have proposed bombing NERV Headquarters.

717
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:24,875
It wouldn't work anyway.

718
01:05:25,378 --> 01:05:27,878
If we lose here, it's all over.

719
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:32,382
Still, it's passed through the second armored layer.

720
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:35,387
It's already begun penetrating the third.

721
01:05:35,391 --> 01:05:38,891
From today it will have to pass through 22 layers total.

722
01:05:38,896 --> 01:05:44,896
It is expected to reach Headquarters tomorrow morning at 0 hours 06 minutes and 54 seconds.

723
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:46,903
That's 10 hours 14 minutes from now.

724
01:05:46,906 --> 01:05:50,406
To make matters worse, Unit 00 is still not battle ready...

725
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:54,410
Unit 01 is also currently unmovable due to it's previous injury.

726
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:57,917
This isn't a very good situation.

727
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,420
We've covered everything, haven't we?

728
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:02,923
Ready to wave the white flag?

729
01:06:03,428 --> 01:06:07,928
Not a bad idea... But before that, I think we should try a little something.

730
01:06:08,934 --> 01:06:12,934
What about the emergency battle plan from the secret agency?

731
01:06:27,453 --> 01:06:32,953
Well, you've drafted quite an insane plan, Captain Katsuragi.

732
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,960
Don't be rude.

733
01:06:34,963 --> 01:06:39,463
It takes 9 hours to implement, and it's the plan with the highest probability of success.

734
01:06:39,469 --> 01:06:44,969
Operation Yashima... It will require the electric power of the entire nation.

735
01:06:45,475 --> 01:06:48,475
A battle plan revolving around experimental research...

736
01:06:48,479 --> 01:06:52,479
...using a still incomplete positron beam cannon.

737
01:06:53,986 --> 01:06:59,486
It's incomplete and hasn't been tuned for use by an Eva...

738
01:07:00,994 --> 01:07:06,494
Well, it's convinced the U.N. forces and the JSDF.

739
01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:11,001
We'll just have to borrow one.

740
01:07:14,009 --> 01:07:16,009
A snake will gather it's friends...

741
01:07:17,514 --> 01:07:22,514
As of midnight tonight, the entire country will suffer a large-scale blackout.

742
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,520
We ask for everyone's cooperation. Again...

743
01:07:34,032 --> 01:07:36,032
Alright, here goes.

744
01:07:36,035 --> 01:07:37,035
Yeah.

745
01:08:08,569 --> 01:08:11,069
The enemy has penetrated through the 7th armored plate!

746
01:08:11,072 --> 01:08:13,072
What is the status of the energy system?

747
01:08:13,075 --> 01:08:17,575
Electric lines will pass through transformer substations directly to chamber 2.

748
01:08:17,581 --> 01:08:22,081
Superconductivity Cable connecting to Mt. Futago is being constructed.

749
01:08:22,086 --> 01:08:27,586
All voltage systems are set to direct there at 22 hours 50 minutes.

750
01:08:28,093 --> 01:08:30,093
What about the sniping system?

751
01:08:30,096 --> 01:08:34,060
No problems with assemply so far. We'll be ready somehow.

752
01:08:34,065 --> 01:08:36,065
What is Unit 01's status?

753
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:39,569
It is currently being fitted with the sniping use G Mold Equipment.

754
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:41,573
It will be ready in another 2 hours.

755
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:44,576
Understood. Now for the pilots.

756
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,080
But, will he pilot it again?

757
01:08:50,587 --> 01:08:54,087
What is the condition of Unit 01's pilot?

758
01:08:54,091 --> 01:08:57,591
The dummy plug test went well.

759
01:08:57,596 --> 01:09:01,596
We may have to make use of it if the pilot cannot fight.

760
01:09:01,601 --> 01:09:04,101
A worst case scenario.

761
01:09:04,104 --> 01:09:07,104
Now is not the time. We can still use Rei.

762
01:09:07,108 --> 01:09:11,108
Rei in Unit 01? That's much too risky...

763
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:17,114
We must use any means to destroy the last 8 Angels.

764
01:09:19,122 --> 01:09:21,622
And what then...

765
01:09:30,134 --> 01:09:32,634
I hate piloting Eva.

766
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,140
Even if I do it, no one praises me.

767
01:09:38,144 --> 01:09:41,644
If I fail, everyone will hate me. All that's left is a horrible death.

768
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:44,650
Why am I here...

769
01:09:46,655 --> 01:09:51,655
If I could change things, I would leave this place.

770
01:09:51,661 --> 01:09:54,161
And leave these thoughts.

771
01:09:54,165 --> 01:09:58,165
If that's so, and you run away from bad things, you can continue to live?

772
01:09:59,671 --> 01:10:01,171
Live?

773
01:10:01,674 --> 01:10:04,174
Why am I alive?

774
01:10:04,177 --> 01:10:07,177
I can't help but want to live...

775
01:10:08,683 --> 01:10:12,183
Father, Misato-san, no one is there for me.

776
01:10:12,188 --> 01:10:15,188
If I can't pilot Eva, I'm no longer needed.

777
01:10:16,193 --> 01:10:18,693
Then I don't want to pilot Eva.

778
01:10:19,697 --> 01:10:21,697
Then I don't want to be here.

779
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,700
But, when I do...

780
01:10:29,709 --> 01:10:31,209
Another unknown ceiling.

781
01:10:33,213 --> 01:10:36,213
When I pilot Eva, this is all I get.

782
01:10:39,721 --> 01:10:41,221
Ayanami...

783
01:10:42,725 --> 01:10:45,225
You've been here the whole time?

784
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:50,730
We will begin Operation Yashima at 00:00 hours.

785
01:10:51,736 --> 01:10:56,736
Pilots Ikari and Ayanami are to report to Cage 2 at 1930 hours.

786
01:10:57,243 --> 01:11:02,243
At 2000 hours Unit 01, and Unit 00 in a support role, will transfer.

787
01:11:02,749 --> 01:11:05,249
At 2005 hours, we launch.

788
01:11:05,253 --> 01:11:08,253
At 2030 we will arrive at Barricade 2 on Mt. Futago.

789
01:11:08,257 --> 01:11:11,257
We will await further instructions there.

790
01:11:11,261 --> 01:11:15,261
The mission begins at midnight.

791
01:11:16,767 --> 01:11:17,767
Food.

792
01:11:19,771 --> 01:11:21,771
I'm... not hungry.

793
01:11:21,774 --> 01:11:23,774
We will leave in 90 minutes.

794
01:11:24,778 --> 01:11:27,278
Then I'll... have to pilot it again.

795
01:11:27,282 --> 01:11:28,282
Yes.

796
01:11:28,283 --> 01:11:32,283
No, I can't. I don't want to have those scary thoughts again.

797
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:36,788
Too frightening... And I can't run away this time...

798
01:11:36,794 --> 01:11:38,794
You're afraid of Eva?

799
01:11:39,798 --> 01:11:41,798
Then stay and rest.

800
01:11:42,802 --> 01:11:43,802
Rest?

801
01:11:44,305 --> 01:11:46,805
I will pilot Unit 01.

802
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:49,810
Ayanami!

803
01:11:50,813 --> 01:11:51,813
Good-bye.

804
01:12:08,332 --> 01:12:10,832
The enemy is penetrating through 17th armored plate!

805
01:12:10,835 --> 01:12:13,835
Target will reach Nerv Headquarters in 4 minutes 55 seconds.

806
01:13:00,886 --> 01:13:03,386
That giant thing is the Positron Gun?

807
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:05,390
Even though it's still being constructed...

808
01:13:05,393 --> 01:13:07,393
...there are no problems with the overall theory.

809
01:13:07,396 --> 01:13:10,896
Zero Control forcibly linking G mold Equipment.

810
01:13:11,401 --> 01:13:13,901
Well, we've done our part.

811
01:13:13,904 --> 01:13:16,404
If only the pilots were so easy...

812
01:13:17,409 --> 01:13:19,409
That's up to you, Misato.

813
01:13:24,417 --> 01:13:27,917
Shinji-kun, you're behind schedule.

814
01:13:30,924 --> 01:13:34,424
You made the decision to stay here, didn't you?

815
01:13:34,929 --> 01:13:37,429
Do your part in this.

816
01:13:38,934 --> 01:13:41,934
I'm afraid... To pilot Eva.

817
01:13:42,939 --> 01:13:45,439
Misato-san and everyone else doesn't understand.

818
01:13:45,443 --> 01:13:48,943
Always giving orders from safe underground...

819
01:13:48,948 --> 01:13:51,948
Only I have to experience that fear...

820
01:13:52,452 --> 01:13:54,452
You're all selfish!

821
01:14:02,463 --> 01:14:04,463
Come with me.

822
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:16,867
15 years ago, the Second Impact tore the world in half.

823
01:14:17,876 --> 01:14:20,876
If the Angels are ever to repeat the Second Impact...

824
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,880
...humanity would surely perish. Everyone.

825
01:14:24,885 --> 01:14:27,385
I've heard all this before...

826
01:14:31,392 --> 01:14:36,392
If an Angel ever reaches Level EEE of NERV Headquarters...

827
01:14:36,398 --> 01:14:39,898
...an Automatic Self-Destruct would commence.

828
01:14:41,904 --> 01:14:45,904
It is a necessary precaution against the Angels, and the Third Impact.

829
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:50,911
Everyone here shares that resolve.

830
01:15:09,426 --> 01:15:10,676
This is...

831
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,930
It can't be...

832
01:15:14,933 --> 01:15:15,933
...Eva?

833
01:15:15,935 --> 01:15:19,435
No. While they began life under the same star...

834
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,940
...this is the second Angel: Lilith.

835
01:15:24,947 --> 01:15:25,947
Lilith...?

836
01:15:25,948 --> 01:15:29,948
Yes, the trigger of the Third Impact.

837
01:15:30,955 --> 01:15:34,955
To protect Lilith, Eva must fight.

838
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,460
And you must do the same.

839
01:15:37,463 --> 01:15:41,963
We have entrusted the future of humanity to Eva, and to you.

840
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:45,970
To do something so important... why me?

841
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:50,975
No particular reason. It's your fate.

842
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:56,480
You're not fighting alone, Shinji-kun.

843
01:15:57,487 --> 01:15:59,487
Everyone is.

844
01:16:03,494 --> 01:16:06,494
One more time. I'll pilot do it.

845
01:16:21,013 --> 01:16:24,513
First, I'll explain the arrangements for this operation.

846
01:16:24,518 --> 01:16:26,518
-Shinji-kun.
-Yes?

847
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,020
You will be gunning from Unit 01.

848
01:16:29,023 --> 01:16:30,023
Yes.

849
01:16:30,026 --> 01:16:32,526
Rei will defend you from Unit 00.

850
01:16:32,529 --> 01:16:34,029
Yes.

851
01:16:34,032 --> 01:16:37,532
This mission will require precise, accurate operation.

852
01:16:37,536 --> 01:16:43,536
For that reason, Unit 01 is more suited than the still unrepaired Unit 00.

853
01:16:44,544 --> 01:16:46,044
Alright, Shinji-kun.

854
01:16:46,047 --> 01:16:50,047
The positron beam is influenced by the Earth's rotation and local gravity....

855
01:16:50,052 --> 01:16:52,052
...so it will not fire in a straight line.

856
01:16:52,054 --> 01:16:55,054
Don't forget to adjust for that error.

857
01:16:55,058 --> 01:16:58,058
You must strike the core in a single shot.

858
01:16:58,063 --> 01:17:01,063
But we don't know where the core is!

859
01:17:01,067 --> 01:17:06,067
It's alright. When the target is in attack form, something materializes within it.

860
01:17:06,573 --> 01:17:09,073
We assume it is the core.

861
01:17:09,077 --> 01:17:14,077
Regular shooting, and this sort of guided sniping are no different.

862
01:17:14,082 --> 01:17:20,082
It's just like in the textbook. When the markers line up in the center, fire.

863
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:23,590
The computer takes care of the rest.

864
01:17:24,595 --> 01:17:30,095
However, this operation will require a focused point of fire.

865
01:17:31,103 --> 01:17:34,103
Unit 01 will not be able to move from it's firing position.

866
01:17:34,602 --> 01:17:37,102
There's no retreating this time...

867
01:17:37,105 --> 01:17:38,605
Yes.

868
01:17:38,608 --> 01:17:41,108
Then if I miss, the enemy will return fire?

869
01:17:41,111 --> 01:17:46,111
Don't think about that. Focus on destroying the target in one shot.

870
01:17:46,618 --> 01:17:48,893
We're in a pretty big pinch, huh?

871
01:17:49,896 --> 01:17:53,396
I... I will protect Unit 01.

872
01:17:53,401 --> 01:17:54,651
Yes.

873
01:17:54,653 --> 01:17:55,903
Understood.

874
01:17:55,906 --> 01:17:58,906
It's time. You two go change.

875
01:17:58,910 --> 01:17:59,910
-Yes.
-Yes.

876
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:10,420
I think...

877
01:18:12,425 --> 01:18:14,925
...we might die this time.

878
01:18:17,431 --> 01:18:19,431
No.

879
01:18:19,434 --> 01:18:21,434
You won't die.

880
01:18:21,938 --> 01:18:23,938
I will protect you.

881
01:18:29,946 --> 01:18:32,446
I'm not much to protect.

882
01:18:33,452 --> 01:18:35,952
There's a message from headquarters.

883
01:18:43,963 --> 01:18:46,963
Ummm, this is Suzuhara.

884
01:18:46,967 --> 01:18:50,467
Ikari, no, I should you Shinji...

885
01:18:50,972 --> 01:18:53,472
Shinji, stay safe.

886
01:18:54,977 --> 01:18:56,977
Ah, this is Aida.

887
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,980
Ikari, good luck.

888
01:19:44,011 --> 01:19:47,011
Ayanami, why do you pilot Eva?

889
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:51,017
Because of my bond.

890
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:53,020
Your bond?

891
01:19:53,023 --> 01:19:55,023
Yes. My bond.

892
01:19:56,527 --> 01:19:58,527
With my father?

893
01:19:59,031 --> 01:20:00,531
With everyone.

894
01:20:01,034 --> 01:20:03,534
You're strong, Ayanami.

895
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:08,040
I don't have anything else.

896
01:20:09,545 --> 01:20:12,045
It's time. Let's go.

897
01:20:15,551 --> 01:20:17,051
Good-bye.

898
01:20:25,062 --> 01:20:30,562
It is currently 00:00 hours. That is all.

899
01:20:35,073 --> 01:20:36,073
It's time.

900
01:20:36,075 --> 01:20:40,575
Shinji-kun, you've chosen to pilot Eva. That alone I'm grateful for.

901
01:20:41,581 --> 01:20:43,081
Thank you.

902
01:20:43,084 --> 01:20:44,834
Begin Operation Yashima.

903
01:20:44,837 --> 01:20:46,837
Prepare Positron Rifle charge.

904
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,590
Initiate first connection.

905
01:20:48,592 --> 01:20:52,092
Roger. Transfering power from water exchange unit.

906
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,597
All cooling systems at full power.

907
01:21:17,123 --> 01:21:18,623
Initiate second connection.

908
01:21:19,627 --> 01:21:23,127
-Starting all accelerators.
-Starting converger.

909
01:21:23,131 --> 01:21:27,631
Transfering power from Mt. Gotemba sub-station. No problems detected.

910
01:21:27,637 --> 01:21:30,637
-Initiate third connection.
-Roger. Beginning connection.

911
01:21:30,641 --> 01:21:32,641
Transfering all energy to Mt. Futago substation.

912
01:21:32,642 --> 01:21:37,642
-All connections running at maximum.
-All cooling systems running at full capacity.

913
01:21:46,156 --> 01:21:48,156
No problems detected with third connection.

914
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:51,159
Understood. Transmit to barricades 4 and 5.

915
01:21:51,163 --> 01:21:53,163
We'll be acting according to plan.

916
01:21:53,166 --> 01:21:55,666
After observing it's reaction, take immediate action.

917
01:22:24,198 --> 01:22:26,698
Defence systems 1 and 3 destroyed!

918
01:22:26,701 --> 01:22:29,201
I see... nothing can pass within it's space. Next!

919
01:22:41,216 --> 01:22:42,716
Barricade 2 has been hit!

920
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:17,251
All power is stored. No problems detected.

921
01:23:17,252 --> 01:23:19,252
The final defence systems have been destroyed!

922
01:23:19,256 --> 01:23:20,756
Pull back the sear!

923
01:23:26,263 --> 01:23:28,763
Launcher Scope attached.

924
01:23:28,767 --> 01:23:33,767
Adjust for the gravity field and revolution of the Earth by -0.0009.

925
01:23:36,776 --> 01:23:38,776
Positron preparations complete.

926
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:42,779
Voltage up 0.2-0.1%.

927
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:45,279
Initiate fifth and final connenction!

928
01:23:45,784 --> 01:23:48,784
All energy being transfered to Positron Gun.

929
01:23:48,788 --> 01:23:51,288
Finalizing positron levels.

930
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:53,791
Momentum is steady through...

931
01:23:55,293 --> 01:23:57,293
Even Ayanami doesn't care...

932
01:23:58,297 --> 01:24:01,797
As skillfull as she is at piloting Eva, she still has no confidence.

933
01:24:01,802 --> 01:24:04,302
She acts without even knowing why...

934
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:07,306
To protect humanity?

935
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:10,310
I can't feel passionate even if it's for something that important...

936
01:24:11,315 --> 01:24:13,315
I wonder why...

937
01:24:14,318 --> 01:24:18,318
13, 12, 11, 10...

938
01:24:18,324 --> 01:24:22,324
9, 8, 7, 6...

939
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:27,329
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

940
01:24:26,834 --> 01:24:28,334
Fire!

941
01:24:48,607 --> 01:24:49,857
Did we get it?!

942
01:24:56,366 --> 01:24:58,866
-It changed?!
-It can't be! Terrible timing...

943
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:01,620
High energy reaction detected in the target!

944
01:25:01,623 --> 01:25:03,623
All hands, brace for impact!

945
01:25:36,659 --> 01:25:38,659
What's the status of the Energy System?

946
01:25:38,662 --> 01:25:41,662
It's already begun to recharge.

947
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:43,667
The Positron Gun?

948
01:25:43,668 --> 01:25:46,668
It's okay. The gun barrel is now cooling.

949
01:25:46,673 --> 01:25:49,173
But we don't know if can manage another shot!

950
01:25:49,176 --> 01:25:51,676
It doesn't matter--we'll do it anyway.

951
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,680
Shinji-kun, are you alright?!

952
01:25:53,683 --> 01:25:56,683
Quickly, get Unit 01 back to firing position!

953
01:25:58,688 --> 01:26:00,188
Shinji-kun?!

954
01:26:09,201 --> 01:26:12,701
IF Unit 01's pilot is unable to take the shot, exchange places!

955
01:26:13,206 --> 01:26:16,206
Unit 00 will take over.

956
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:17,710
Ikari!

957
01:26:17,712 --> 01:26:20,712
If we're unable to use him, we have no other choice.

958
01:26:20,716 --> 01:26:24,716
Please wait! He chose to pilot Eva without running away.

959
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:28,721
He chose this with his own will. I trust him!

960
01:26:30,728 --> 01:26:32,728
Shinji, do us proud.

961
01:26:32,731 --> 01:26:34,731
Ikari, good luck.

962
01:26:51,751 --> 01:26:54,251
Believe in your son!

963
01:27:01,763 --> 01:27:04,263
I believe in Unit 01's pilot!

964
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:10,269
I'll leave it to you then. Do as you please.

965
01:27:10,272 --> 01:27:12,272
Thank you, sir!

966
01:27:12,777 --> 01:27:14,277
Shinji-kun.

967
01:27:14,278 --> 01:27:15,278
...Yes?

968
01:27:15,281 --> 01:27:17,781
All of Japan's energy is with you.

969
01:27:18,785 --> 01:27:23,785
All of our hopes, the future of humanity, and every living creature...

970
01:27:24,792 --> 01:27:27,792
...has been entrusted to you. You can do it.

971
01:27:28,296 --> 01:27:29,296
Yes!

972
01:27:31,801 --> 01:27:34,301
Gun barrel in position!

973
01:27:34,305 --> 01:27:36,305
Unit 01's G Mold Equipment has been discarded!

974
01:27:36,307 --> 01:27:39,307
Final firing system switched to manual!

975
01:27:47,319 --> 01:27:49,819
The enemy has reached the Headquarters!

976
01:27:49,824 --> 01:27:51,324
Ready second shot!

977
01:27:52,827 --> 01:27:55,327
Gun barrel fuse cooling complete!

978
01:28:02,337 --> 01:28:04,837
Firing coordinates complete!

979
01:28:04,842 --> 01:28:08,342
Calculations corrected! It's up to the pilot now!

980
01:28:12,015 --> 01:28:14,015
Another high energy reaction detected in the target!

981
01:28:14,018 --> 01:28:15,018
Watch out!

982
01:28:23,529 --> 01:28:24,529
Shinji-kun!

983
01:28:36,543 --> 01:28:37,543
Ayanami!

984
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:44,051
The shield won't be able to hold it!

985
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:45,052
Is it ready?!

986
01:28:45,054 --> 01:28:46,054
20 more seconds!

987
01:28:55,566 --> 01:28:57,566
Hurry... Hurry...

988
01:29:00,071 --> 01:29:01,071
Hurry up!

989
01:29:33,105 --> 01:29:34,105
We did it!

990
01:30:04,638 --> 01:30:06,138
Ayanami!

991
01:30:11,146 --> 01:30:12,146
Ayanami!

992
01:30:45,181 --> 01:30:46,181
Ayanami!

993
01:30:46,183 --> 01:30:47,183
Are you okay?!

994
01:30:47,184 --> 01:30:49,684
Ayanami! Ayanami!

995
01:30:59,698 --> 01:31:03,698
Don't say "I don't have anything else."

996
01:31:06,706 --> 01:31:11,206
Don't say "good-bye" before a mission... it's too sad...

997
01:31:20,721 --> 01:31:22,721
What? You're crying.

998
01:31:25,227 --> 01:31:30,227
I'm sorry, I don't know what expression to have at times like these.

999
01:31:31,734 --> 01:31:33,734
A smile is enough.

1000
01:32:11,756 --> 01:32:15,756
Yes, I know. That boy is awakening.

1001
01:32:15,761 --> 01:32:17,761
He has already entered the stage.

1002
01:32:19,265 --> 01:32:23,765
That's right. As it is written in The Dead Sea Scrolls.

1003
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:26,270
The time to fulfill the contract is near.

1004
01:32:30,778 --> 01:32:32,778
They're only on the third one.

1005
01:32:32,782 --> 01:32:34,782
You never change, do you?

1006
01:32:36,286 --> 01:32:39,786
I look foward to meeting you, Ikari Shinji-kun.
