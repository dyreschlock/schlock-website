We will go through all the questions and answers together after students have a chance to discuss amongst themselves.  For listening classes, we'll run through the dialogue again and again so students have a chance to listen many times. After listening is complete, we'll quickly go through the meaning of the dialogue so students have an idea of the story up through the current point.

<b>Performance Tests</b>

Each section of the class leads to a performance test. Performance Tests are performed by two students creating a pair. For the first performance, students will decide on playing either Lori or Tree and focus their own roles. But for the second and third tests, dialogue is only from one character. Students will still form pairs, but will supporting the other person. Then, they'll switch characters.

Performance Tests are graded with the following criteria under the following categories.

<table class="grades">

Each of these 12 criteria constitutes 2 points each. 0 for not doing it. 1 for doing it. And, 2 for doing it well.

Speaking the dialogue correctly is important, but the goal of the exercise is to correctly <b>express</b> the dialogue together with your partner. Acting isn't something you do by yourself. The scene is a combination of the two actors together, supporting and working off of each other.

This is especially important in scenes where a character has no dialogue. Even though they aren't saying anything, they should show the correct emotions and gestures to bring the dialogue out of their partner.

<b>Grades</b>

The overall grades for the class are created from 20% participation and 80% test scores.

The participation grade comes from completing the listening assignments in class and turning them in. If you miss class, it's up to you to complete them on your own. Test scores are created from the above criteria.
