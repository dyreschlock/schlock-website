Essays are first written in notebooks, and each part of the paragraph is written step-by-step. When sections of paragraphs are okay and make sense, students can proceed to the next section and next paragraph. Notebooks shall be turned in on a regular basis to keep steady progress and meet deadlines.

As notebooks are turned in, I will mark various spelling and grammar errors, and make notes where the contents are weak or don't make sense. When receiving your notebook, write the contents again while answering questions and including contents written in my notes.

Only until the current paragraph is complete will we continue to the next paragraph.

<b>Grades</b>

Grades are created from the overall progress of your essay in your notebook. In the notebook, each paragraph is worth 15 points. 10 points from finishing the paragraph, 3 points from finishing the paragraph on time, and 2 points from finishing it before the deadline. Again, paragraphs aren't finished until I mark them with an "ok."

The final typed report has a total of 90 points. Each paragraph is 15 points, and points are deducted from spelling, grammar, and format errors, and from any missing contents. 10 points are giving if the report is completed on time, or deducted if your printed report has too many errors and I return it to you to fix. The last 20 points are from the earlier progression in your notebook, listed above with each paragraph being 5 points.

<b>Epilogue - Debate</b>

It should take around 7 or 8 months for students to complete their essay. Starting in March, they'll most likely finish by the end of November, leaving another 2 months of classes left until their final tests and graduation. If there are enough classes remaining, they can be used for an <b>English Debate</b>.

Students are split into two teams. One team thinks that <b>Cognitive Relativity</b> is more correct. The other team thinks that <b>Cognitive Determinism</b> is more correct.

Within their groups, students are expected to talk about the contents of their essay, find some commonality from the arguments made in their essay, and create a list of their 3 best arguments. These points are then attacked by the other team. After, the team must defend their points from the attack. This follows the <a href="https://henda.global/">Japanese English Debate</a> structure.
