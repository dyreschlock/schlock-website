We will proceed writing the essay step-by-step. Students will write out sentences for their first paragraphs in their notebooks in the order listed on the sheet. When students complete their paragraph, they'll turn in their notebooks, and I'll check their work.

I'll mark the various spelling and grammar errors, and in addition to making memos. If ideas aren't fully explained, or sentences don't make sense, or overall paragraphs don't follow the intended flow or include unnecessary ideas, I'll write a memo. Notebooks are returned to students for them to rewrite the paragraph with the various changes. This process will continue until the contents of the paragraph are complete.

Only until the current paragraph is complete, will students start writing the next paragraph.

<b>Grades</b>

Grades are created from the usual 20% / 80% split. 20% of the grade is keeping up with turning in notebooks each week and making steady progress. 80% is a harsh grading of the final written report. Contents will most likely be fine, but there should be no spelling or grammar errors, nor any parts missing from the progress done in the notebooks.
