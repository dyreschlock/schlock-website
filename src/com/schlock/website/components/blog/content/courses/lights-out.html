Depending on time, some of these classes can be cut. For listening classes, we'll run through the dialogue again and again so students have a chance to listen many times. After listening is complete, we'll quickly go through the meaning of the dialogue if it's necessary. Some classes, like 12, focus only on the dialogue's meaning.

<b>Performance Tests</b>

Each section of the class lead to a performance test. Performance Tests are performed by two students creating a pair. In pairs, students will decide who portray which character. They'll practice pronunciation, memorization, but they'll also practice showing correct emotions and expressions when speaking the dialogue.

Performance Tests are graded with the following criteria under the following categories.

<table class="grades">
    <tr>
        <th>Correctness</th>
        <th>Expression</th>
        <th>Cooperation</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
            <b>Pronunciation</b><br/>
            Saying the words with the correct pronunciation.
        </td>
        <td>
            <b>Memorized</b><br/>
            Remember your lines. Do not look at the script.
        </td>
        <td>
            <b>Eye Contact</b><br/>
            Look at your partner in the eyes at the correct times.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
            <b>Intonation</b><br/>
            Speak the sentences using the correct rhythm and flow of English.
        </td>
        <td>
            <b>Facial Expression</b><br/>
            Use the correct facial expressions when speaking your dialogue.

        <td>
            <b>Vocal Reactions</b><br/>

    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
            <b>Audible</b><br/>
            Speak the dialogue loud enough with the proper volume.
        </td>
        <td>
            <b>No Laughing / Smiling</b><br/>
            Using the correct emotions means that you shouldn't "break" during the scene.
        </td>
        <td>
            <b>Facial Reactions</b><br/>
            React correctly to your partner with facial expressions.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>
            <b>Body Expressions</b><br/>
            Use the correct gestures and body movement to convey your dialogue.
        </td>
        <td>
            <b>Movement Reactions</b>
            React correctly to your partner with gestures and body movement.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>
            <b>No Standing Still</b><br/>
            Using the correct body movement means that you aren't standing still while delivering your dialogue.
        </td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>

Each of these 12 criteria constitutes 2 points each. 0 for not doing it. 1 for doing it. And, 2 for doing it well.

Speaking the dialogue correctly is important, but the goal of the exercise is to correctly <b>express</b> the dialogue together with your partner. Acting isn't something you do by yourself. The scene is a combination of the two actors together, supporting and working off of each other. So, in grading, this is also considered.

The expressions for the first performance test are pretty easy, but the second test has deeper emotions that carry that overall meaning of the scene.

<b>Grades</b>

The overall grades for the class are created from 20% participation and 80% test scores.

The participation grade comes from completing the listening assignments in class and turning them in. If you miss class, it's up to you to complete them on your own. Test scores are created from the above criteria.
