sunday-dream-introduction=Once upon a time in a far off kingdom there was a knight named Cecil.  He was a noble and honorable knight was always helped out those in need.  And the world needed more knights like him.  The people of this kingdom would stab each other in the back for any amount of wealth.\
  <br/><br/>One sunny, beautiful day, the king called upon Cecil to go on a grand journey.  On the far side of the continent war had broken out.  The evil, godless faction of warlords have attacked the kingdom's allied neighbors, and if they were to fall, the kingdom would be next.\
  <br/><br/>Cecil set off on his journey at once, but there are many obstacles in his path.

sunday-dream-introduction2=You see before you a vast desert that extends beyond your vision. Everything is muted in color and feels very surreal. The air is stiff and dry, but you can smell something, almost charred. It doesn't smell very good, but the pangs in your guts tell you that its been awhile since your last meal. Thinking about food, you recall how thirsty you are as well.\
  <br/><br/>Off in the distance you can make out the shape of a building, it seems old and run-down, but it appears to be a gas station, and you think there might be food, or at least something useful. Beyond that you can make out some mountains on the horizon. There is no sun in the sky, and it feels about dusk. You wonder how much time is left before nightfall, and you make way to the building, hoping for something.

monday-day-introduction=And I'm awake.  The sound of my alarm clock rips me from my dream, and I'm back in reality.  It's the beginning of the week, and it's time to see what's in store for the week.
monday-day-work=Today, I have a very important meeting in the morning.  All of the execs have been called in, and I meet with them just a little bit after I arrive.  Our company hasn't been doing well in the past year thanks to rival acquisitions and harsh competition.\
  <br/><br/>"This is our last week," our CEO declares.  "Friday is our final chance to keep this company afloat.  Investors will be here, and we'll give them a <b>presentation</b> about what we stand for.  It's all or nothing.  We either get the support we need, or we're dead."\
  <br/><br/>With that last line, I think he got everyone's attention, and the severity began to sink in.  "I'm putting <b>you</b> in charge of this," he says as he points to me.  "Make sure to impress <b>this guy</b> because he's a real asshole."\
  <br/><br/>After the meeting, I get to work.  It's all on me.  But it's not too difficult.  I should have no problem coming up with the presentation by the end of the week as long as I <b>spend enough time</b> on it.

monday-evening-introduction=After a stressful day, it's time to relax.
monday-evening-music_store=Before heading home, I stop at my local music store.  I can spend hours here sifting through all the records they have in stock, and looking for something new, old, or different.\
  <br/><br/>Sarah is at the register, and I talk with her for a little while.  She mentions that the new <b>Phoenix Album</b> comes out tomorrow and how everyone in the shop is excited for it.  I'm pretty excited too.\
  <br/><br/>The sub shop is next door, so I grab a sandwich for dinner.
monday-evening-grocery_store=I make a stop at the Grocery Store on the way home.  Strolling through the aisles, I pick up a few things here and there that I'm missing at home, but I'm not really coming up with anything specific for tonight's meal.\
  <br/><br/>But maybe this will do.  There's a big display that holds a bunch of <b>melons</b> that just arrived.  Hell yeah!  <span class="blue">Melons for dinner!</span>
monday-evening-friends=I stop off at my friends' place and talk about the day's event.  Tom can barely hold in his excitement for the new <b>Phoenix Album</b> that comes out tomorrow.  We're all big fans of the group.\
  <br/><br/>The hours pass on by, and we order some Chinese food, and complain about politics, and music.

monday-night-introduction=The sun sets, and the night is upon us.  It's starting to get a little late.
monday-night-bar=This whole week is going to suck, so why not drink to forget!  The bar is a little bit crowded thanks to Monday Night football.  Drunken cheers and screams surround me. <b>Tom</b> is at the bar, and we chat for a while.\
  <br/><br/>Eventually, I make it back home and pass out.
monday-night-bed=This whole week is going to suck, so I'd better get my sleep and be fresh for tomorrow morning.  My cozy bed feels great, and I drift off to sleep.

monday-dream-introduction-music_store-bar=Cecil's first night on the road brings him to a small town in the middle of the plains.  There's only a few houses, and the inn is rather small but will do.  Cecil enters the inn and asks for a room.\
  <br/><br/>"You've got a lot of nerve showing your face here fancy knight," exclaims the inn keeper.  "You're riding around on your fancy horse in your fancy armor while the people out here <b>starve</b>.  What are you going to do for us?"\
  <br/><br/>Cecil is a trained guitar player, and asks if performing a song would raise spirits.  "No, you fool.  How is that going to help?"\
  <br/><br/>Cecil has quite a bit of gold on him, and asks if he bought everyone a drink at the bar if that would help.  "No, you fool.  Drinking is only going to make the people of this town <b>starve</b> faster."\
  <br/><br/>Cecil is out of options.  Disatisfied with Cecil, the people of the town crowd around him, take his horse, his money, and then his life.

  <br/><br/>Cecil has plenty of resources back in the kingdom with his friends.  If he sent a message back to the castle, they could bring help.  "Your promises mean nothing to us.  We're <b>starving</b> now, and need help now.  Not in a weeks."\

monday-dream-introduction2=You stand outside a decaying, overgrown gas station. The windows are busted out, there is a lot of vandalism. You can feel the hairs on the back over your neck rise, awaiting what might lurk inside. After a minute or so, lightning crashes, and moments later brings downpour. You are forced to take shelter inside, whether or not there is friend or foe waiting. Inside the place is abandoned much like the outside. Cans of expired food are scattered about. However, you find some canteens in the back half of the store.\
  <br/><br/>Fill them with rain water?

tuesday-dream-introduction=A terrifying rain storm stops Cecil in his tracks.  The downpour has continued for days and days, and has washed away most of the road.  Cecil can barely travel, and hasn't seen anyone in days.  Floods cover the landscape.\
  <br/><br/>Cecil seeks shelter in a nearby cave.  It's on the side of the hill, and has avoided any flooding.  As Cecil explores the depths of the cave, it's more and more apparent that this is not a naturally formed cave.\
  <br/><br/>In the back of the cave is an alter.  Two unlit torches occupy the sides of the alter.

tuesday-dream-introduction2=The rain has stopped and you can see smoke on the horizon. You figure there isn't much left here, and you take off in the direction of the smoke.

There is little here, (footsteps leading off?) kindling and a mostly dead fire. It is almost nightfall.

winter2=Extinquish the remains of the fire?
summer2=or Reignite the fire?

wednesday-dream-introduction=The rain finally stops, and Cecil is able to continue on his journey to the fight.  He skips several towns, and continues riding through the night to make up time, and he reaches the battle.\
  <br/><br/>An army is sieging a battered fortress.  This battle must have been going on for months.  Bodies litter the landscape, and both sides are down to only a few fighters left.  The remnants of the warlords army and the soldiers of the fortress exchange arrows here and there, but the battle is at a stand still.\
  <br/><br/>That's where Cecil comes in.  The fortress now has a fighting chance.  Cecil rides into the encampment of the warlords and slays the remaining foes.  Two warlord generals appear from their tents, and face Cecil in battle.\
  <br/><br/>One general is a burly man with axe, and the other is a rough woman with knives.  Cecil needs to decide who to fight first.

male=Fight the woman.
female=Fight the man.

  <br/><br/>Cecil knows this verse.  It was written in the cave.  But he doesn't know what it means.  The man readies his axe, and charges at Cecil.  Cecil dodges the blow, but it not prepared for the man quick follow up attack.  The back of Cecil's head is crushed by the axe, and he is slain.

thursday-day-introduction=...And back to reality as my alarm beeps and beeps and beeps.  That's the fourth night in a row that I've had this dream, and it's getting more and more vivid.
thursday-day-work=But I need to focus on the work I have ahead of me.  <b>Tomorrow</b> is the big presentation and my work is slowly getting done.  I have the financial reports from accounting, and the market saturation reports from our marketing team.  Integrating these into the presentation should make our company stand out.

thursday-evening-friends-male-yes=After a fantastic party last night, I just have to tell my friends about it.  "DJ Chemo is fan-frickin-tastic.  He builds this tremendous atmosphere that pounds and pounds."  I describe all the fun times, and show them the <b>flyer</b>.\
  <br/><br/>"Chemo invited me to some event tomorrow night on the north side, and you guys should definitely join us," I ask them.  "<b>Dave</b> should be there as well."  And they agree, "That sounds like an amazing time.  <b>Dave's</b> a great person to hang out with.  <span class="blue">Count us in!</span>"
thursday-evening-friends-female-yes=After a fantastic party last night, I just have to tell my friends about it.  "DJ Chemo is fan-frickin-tastic.  He builds this tremendous atmosphere that pounds and pounds."  I describe all the fun times, and show them the <b>flyer</b>.\
  <br/><br/>"Chemo invited me to some event tomorrow night on the north side, and you guys should definitely join us," I ask them.  "<b>Sharla</b> should be there as well."  They express their disatisfaction.  "It sounds like a fun time, but if <b>Sharla</b> is involved, then we won't go anywhere near that place.  She is bad business."
thursday-evening-friends-no=I stop off at my friends' place, and join them on the porch.  They are mostly talking about politics again.  I mention how amazing the new <b>Phoenix Album</b> is, and how we should try and get tickets for one of their upcoming shows.\
  <br/><br/>Eventually we order some sub sandwiches from the shop down the road, and meander around town.
thursday-evening-home=Yet another day complete, and I'm going to spend it at home.  I make some dinner from the groceries I already have, and watch some syndicated TV.  Not much is going on in the world tonight.

thursday-night-introduction=The sun sets, and the city is covered in darkness once again.  I need to get some sleep tonight for the big presentation tomorrow morning.
thursday-night-bed=Tomorrow is the day.  Doomsday.  It's either sink or swim for my company, and it's all riding on my shoulders.  But my work throughout the week will completely pay off tomorrow.

thursday-dream-introduction-female=The woman introduces herself as <b>Nina</b>.  Cecil and Nina travel to <b>The Edge</b> where the warlords live.  It's a beautiful area on the ocean.  The sky is blue, the sand is red, and the trees are a brilliant green.\
  <br/><br/>The scenery frames a horrible looking castle.  Even at the brightest time of day, the castle is pitch black.  Decaying corpses and ships litter the beach surrounding the castle.\
  <br/><br/>"That's <b>Black Castle</b>, and all the warlords are inside.  We should take our time to prepare for the battle.  When should we strike?"
thursday-dream-introduction-male=The man introduces himself as <b>Zarbash</b>.  Cecil and Zarbash travel to <b>The Edge</b> where the warlords live.  It's a beautiful area on the ocean.  The sky is blue, the sand is red, and the trees are a brilliant green.\

full=Wait three weeks.
waning_gibbous=Wait a month.

thursday-dream-waxing_crescent=Cecil replies, "I say we attack now.  We can't let their trechery continue a moment longer."\
  <br/><br/>They wait for the night to fall, and attack.  A <b>sliver of a moon</b> hangs in the sky as they approach the castle.
thursday-dream-waxing_half=Cecil replies, "We should at least take a week to prepare for the battle.  There's no sense in rushing to our deaths."\
  <br/><br/>Over the next week, the two warriors build a cache of arrows.  They wait for the night to fall, and attack.  <b>Half a moon</b> hangs in the sky as they approach the castle.
thursday-dream-waxing_gibbous=Cecil replies, "We should wait two weeks before attacking.  That should give us enough time to prepare."\
  <br/><br/>In two weeks, the two warriors build a cache of arrows, and plenty of spears.  They wait for the nigth to fall, and attack.  A <b>near full moon</b> hangs in the sky as they approach the castle.
thursday-dream-full=Cecil replies, "We should wait three weeks until we have a <b>Full Moon</b>.  It'll be easier to attack when we can see what's going on."\
  <br/><br/>The two warriors get to work building a cache of arrow, and spears.  They patiently wait for the moon to be its fullest, and attack.
thursday-dream-waning_gibbous=Cecil replies, "We should wait a month.  That should give us enough time to get any resources we'll need to attack."\
  <br/><br/>The two warriors build a cache of arrows and spears.  They travel to any nearby towns and gather what mercenaries they can.  A month later, they wait for the night to fall, and attack.  A <b>wanning moon</b> hangs in the sky.

thursday-dream-introduction2=Your new friend shares with you some dried and dirty meat, it smells gross, and it has the textures of sand...but you haven't eaten in days. Your friend then tells you about this camp, and what to expect, you two chat over the best time to strike in the night.

friday-day-introduction=Today's the big day.  I take a long shower in the morning, brush my teeth, and head off to work feeling pretty good.

friday-day-work-no=As I arrive, all the investors are already here.  The lead investor is up on the top floor talking with our CEO.  And I head to my desk, and prepare all my documents for the meeting.\
  <br/><br/>It's 10am, and time to shine.  I lay out all the work that I've done, detail our financial situation, and how we can become profitable.  I show how are market saturation is perfect is we only had a little more support.  But, I stumble over my words a bit, and some of my facts don't really check out.  I think the investors are starting to see through my bullshit.\
  <br/><br/>After concluding my poorly prepared presentation, the CEO demands that I leave the room, as he continues to negotiate with the investors over some possible deal.  But he fails.  He fails, because I have failed.  I did not <b>spend enough time at work</b> to make a compelling argument for our company.\
  <br/><br/>The investors leave our company, and we're left with ourselves.  The CEO fires me on the spot, and that's it.  No more job, and no more company.

friday-day-work-yes-waxing_crescent=As I arrive, all the investors are already here.  The lead investor is up on the top floor talking with our CEO.  And I head to my desk, and prepare all my documents for the meeting.\
  <br/><br/>It's 10am, and time to shine.  I set up my structured presentation, and hand out my reports.  I detail a clear cut road map for how we can become profitable.  I display which markets are lucrative, and how our products can boost our profits.  And I make a plea the investors and outline all the capital that we'd need to see it through, and turn out company around.\
  <br/><br/>Everything went perfectly to plan, and a smile runs across the CEO's face.  <b>We've done it.</b>  This is what our company is about, and this is what will keep us from going bankrupt.  I accuse myself, and the CEO and investors continue to negotiate.\
  <br/><br/>After a while, the investors leave without saying anything, and the CEO calls me up to his office.  "You did a fantastic job this morning, but it wasn't enough.  The investors are looking to buy.  One could say that their interest in our company is <b>waxing</b>, but it's seem our company is <b>too much for them right now.</b>  They might be able to buy us a couple months down the line, but we can't stay in business that long.  <b>We've failed.</b>

  <br/><br/>Not too much longer after I left the room, the CEO called the entire company into the atrium on the top floor to announce that we've been <b>purchased</b>!  The investors were impressed by the presentation, and were looking for a company exactly like ours.  <span class="blue">We did it!</span>

friday-evening-introduction=Success! Success! Success!  The company is saved.  We all still have jobs.  And life is going pretty damn good!
friday-evening-home=I'm going to head straight home, get out of these work clothes, and relax for a few hours.  The stressful life of a company man is over for the week.\
  <br/><br/>I make some delicious dinner, and pop a couple beers.  I am ready for whatever the weekend holds for me!

friday-night-introduction=I am ready for whatever the weekend holds for me.

friday-night-bar=I'm going to get my drink on!  My manic mindset is ready to explode and let's fuel it with beer and tear up the night!\
  <br/><br/><b>Tom</b> meets me at the bar, and he congratulates me on my success earlier in the day.  We drink quite a bit of beer, and meet up with our other friends too.  It's a great night of complaining about politics, and yelling at each other.\
  <br/><br/>Some time later, I finally make it home, and pass out immediately.  I drift off to sleep, but I have no dreams.  I have no adventures with Cecil and the kingdoms, and I never do ever again.
friday-night-club=I'm going to head to the club, and dance dance dance the night away.  There's a decent amount of people here tonight, but it's missing the normal underground crowd.\
  <br/><br/>DJ Normal continues to spin throughout the night, and it's pretty fun.  But ultimately, its a dissapointing night after getting my hopes up.\
  <br/><br/>I get home rather late, and fall asleep immediately, but I don't dream.  There's nothing until I awake the next day.  And I never dream about Cecil or kingdoms again.
friday-night-bed=But maybe, I'll hold off the celebration for tomorrow.  I don't need to get completely drunk tonight, I have the whole weekend to spread my cheer.\
  <br/><br/>I fall asleep and await my continued journey with Cecil and the kingdoms, but nothing comes to me.  I dream of nothing.  And I never have that dream again.

friday-night-party=Tonight is the night of that amazing party.  I call a cab, and have them bring me to the north side of town where the address on the <b>flyer</b> indicates.
